In this paper, we endeavor to unearth the obstacles that impede LLMs in graph reasoning, pinpointing the common practice of converting graphs into natural language descriptions (Graph2Text) as a fundamental bottleneck.

This integration equips LLMs with the capability to proficiently interpret and reason on graph data, harnessing the superior expressive power of graph learning models. [📃](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05845 "GraphLLM: Boosting Graph Reasoning Ability of Large Language Model")
